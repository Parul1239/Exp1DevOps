Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle 
everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work 
among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear 
workflows.
