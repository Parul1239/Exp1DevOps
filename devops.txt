DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to 
deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than 
organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
